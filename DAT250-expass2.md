# Assignment 2

## Technical Problems
When installing and using the java persistence architecture I encountered a couple of problems related to my JDK version.
The installation instructions for eclipselink in the tutorial provided used a newer version of JDK than I have installed, and it took a while to figure out how to change the version and add the correct jars to my buildpath.
The installation of Apache Derby was not necessarily filled with technical problems, but understanding the tool and how to use it took some time getting used to.
Most of the problems encountered with the use of JPA was solved with a lot of testing and searching for various solutions online until i understood how to use it.

Here is a link to my repository with experiment 1 and 2: [https://github.com/Aredae/DAT250LAB2](https://github.com/Aredae/DAT250LAB2)

To inspect the database tables i used the derby's ij scripting tool. With this I could query the database after connecting to it. By running the __show tables;__ command i got and overview of the tables in my database.
I also ran simple SQL queries to inspect certain tables.
