## Technical Problems With MongoDB

I encountered almost no problems when installing MongoDB on my machine. Since I am on Windows the installation wizard made it easy to get it up and running. 
The only problem I encountered was that I had to restart my computer for the installation to complete, and after a reboot the server was shut down.
I solved this by going into the services console and starting the server from there.

**My MapReduce Operation**

The MapReduce Operation I developed obtains a collection of each item with the total ammount of money spent on each item. This can be useful for figuring out how much money any given item has made. By studying this information, items that make little money can be replaced.

I have no pending issues with this assignment.
