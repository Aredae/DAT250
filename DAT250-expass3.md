## Technical Problems With MongoDB

I encountered almost no problems when installing MongoDB on my machine. Since i am on Windows the installation wizard made it easy to get it up and running. 
The only problem I encountered was that I had to restart my computer for the installation to proceed, and after a reboot the server what shut down.
I solved this by going into the services console and started the server from there.
